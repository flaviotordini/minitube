It is a D-Bus interface and so you can eg. Control Minitube from the command line.
However, it's not what I intended. My plan was to create your Freedesktop
compatible D-Bus interface. Unfortunately, this requires a much more complex
logic and you have to register several interfaces. The scope of this
implementation exceeds my available time. Apart from that, I've implemented
the systray context menu control, which comes to the same thing.

Example:
dbus-send --session \
	--type=method_call \
	--dest=org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.minitube \
	/org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 \
	org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.minitube.Previous
