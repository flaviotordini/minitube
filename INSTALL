# Build instructions

## Prerequisites
To compile Minitube you need at least Qt 4.5, Qt >= 4.6 is recommended.
The following Qt modules are needed: core, gui, network, xml, phonon, dbus

On a Debian or Ubuntu system type:
sudo apt-get install build-essential qt4-dev-tools libphonon-dev

## Compiling
Run:
    $ qmake
and then:
    $ make
Beware of the Qt3 version of qmake! If things go wrong try running qmake-qt4 instead.

## Running
./build/target/minitube

## A word about Phonon on Linux
To be able to actually listen to music you need a working Phonon setup.
Please don't contact me about this, ask for help on your distribution support channels.

## Installing on Linux
Run:
    $ sudo make install
This is for packagers. End users should not install applications in this way.
